Keyed
=====

Keyed provides a high-level, Pythonic framework for creating animations.

Keyed is named after key frames (`key frames`_), a concept in animation indicating the start or end of an animation.

To get started and install Keyed, see :doc:`installation`.

For a tutorial on how to use Keyed, see :doc:`tutorial`.

For more information about the overall design of Keyed, see :doc:`design`.

Keyed was created with the primary goal of making animating Code simple. Other libraries will do many things
better than this library.
