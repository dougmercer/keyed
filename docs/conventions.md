# Conventions

This section explains several conventions used in this documentation.

## Symbols

This documentation use some symbols for illustration purposes. Before you read
on, please make sure you've made yourself familiar with the following list of
conventions:

### <!-- md:sponsors --> – Sponsors only { data-toc-label="Sponsors only" }

The pumping heart symbol denotes that a specific feature or behavior is only
available to sponsors via [Extras][extras/index.md]. Make sure that you have access to
[Extras][extras/index.md] if you want to use the feature.

### <!-- md:version --> – Version { data-toc-label="Version" }

The tag symbol in conjunction with a version number denotes when a specific
feature or behavior was added. Make sure you're at least on this version
if you want to use it.

### <!-- md:flag experimental --> – Experimental { data-toc-label="Experimental" }

Some newer features are still considered experimental, which means they might
change at any time, including their complete removal.
