# Keyed Extras

<!-- md:sponsors -->

`keyed-extras` is a Python package that extends the keyed animation library. It provides early access to exclusive features that aren't available in the community edition.

You can get access to `keyed-extras` by becoming a [Sponsor :heart:{ .heart .pulsing }](https://github.com/dougmercer).

## How it Works

Keyed Extras follows a progressive Sponsorware model. New features start in Extras and, as we meet community goals, graduate to the core open-source library.

1. New features are initially released in Keyed Extras.
2. [Sponsors :heart:{ .heart .pulsing }](https://github.com/dougmercer) receive early access.
3. We set community sponsorship goals for each feature
4. When a goal is met, that features moves to the core `keyed` library
5. Everyone benefits from improved open-source animations! :party:

## What's in it for you?

As a sponsor, you'll get:

- Immediate access to all current Extras features
- Updates and new features as they're released
- Early access to experimental features before they potentially move to the core library
- Help progress toward collective goals of open-sourcing features
- The ability to continue using the version you have even if your sponsorship ends

## How to get Extras

1. Become a GitHub sponsor through [our sponsorship page](https://github.com/sponsors/dougmercer/)
2. You'll receive access to the private repository
3. Install `keyed-extras`:
   ```console
   pip install git+https://github.com/dougmercer-yt/keyed-extras.git
   ```

<!-- TODO, link to more detailed install instructions on the keyed-extras repo when it's available. -->
