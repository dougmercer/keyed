# Keyed Extras

Keyed Extras is a Sponsorware package that extends the keyed animation library with powerful and useful features.

## What is Extras?

Keyed Extras is a collection of premium features for the keyed animation library, available exclusively to GitHub sponsors. It provides sophisticated tools that enhance your animations with advanced effects, improved code visualization, and artistic rendering capabilities.

Features include:

- Renderable "code editor window" which supports scrolling and resizing
- Improved syntax highlighting powered by `jedi`
- Freehand drawing context for natural, hand-drawn effect
- A new Squiggly line object
- (Experimental) Rich collection of raster-based post-processing effects
  - Blur and bloom effects
  - Color adjustment tools
  - Glow effects
  - Artistic filters (painterly, dither, halftone)
- (Experimental) Advanced fill patterns
  - Gradients
  - Cross hatching
  - Checkboard patterns
  - Polka dots
  - Stippling
- (Experimental) Image object support
- And more features, coming here first

## What's in it for me?

As a sponsor, you'll get:

- Immediate access to all current Extras features
- Updates and new features as they're released
- Early access to experimental features before they potentially move to the core library
- Help progress toward collective goals of open-sourcing features
- The ability to continue using the version you have even if your sponsorship ends
