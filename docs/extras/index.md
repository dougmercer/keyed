# Keyed Extras

`keyed-extras` is a Python package that provides early access to exclusive features that aren't available in the community edition of `keyed`.

You can get access to `keyed-extras` by becoming a [Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/dougmercer) <!-- md:sponsors -->.

## How it Works

Keyed Extras follows a progressive Sponsorware model. New features start in Extras and, as we meet community goals, graduate to the core open-source library.

1. New features are initially released in Keyed Extras.
2. [Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/dougmercer) <!-- md:sponsors --> receive early access.
3. We set community sponsorship goals for each feature
4. When a goal is met, that features moves to the core `keyed` library
5. Everyone benefits from improved open-source animations! ðŸŽ‰

## What's in it for you?

As a sponsor, you'll get:

- Immediate access to all current Extras features
- Updates and new features as they're released
- Early access to experimental features before they potentially move to the core library
- Help progress toward collective goals of open-sourcing features
- The ability to continue using the version you have even if your sponsorship ends

## How to get Extras

1. Become a GitHub sponsor through [our sponsorship page](https://github.com/sponsors/dougmercer/)
2. You'll receive access to the private repository and package index.
3. [Install `keyed-extras`](https://extras.keyed.dev/install/).
