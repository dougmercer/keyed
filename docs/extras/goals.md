# Community Goals

Keyed Extras follows a progressive Sponsorware model. Features start in Extras and, as we meet community goals, graduate to the core open-source library. :heart:{ .heart .pulsing }

## How it Works

1. New features are initially developed in Keyed Extras
2. We set community sponsorship goals for each feature
3. When a goal is met, that feature moves to the core `keyed` library
4. Everyone benefits from improved open-source animations

## Feature Roadmap

We're continuously developing new features for Extras. Upcoming additions include:
- 3D rendering support
- Physics simulations
- Advanced particle systems
- Timeline editor

These features will follow the same path: starting in Extras and potentially moving to core based on community support.
