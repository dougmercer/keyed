# Fair Use Policy

Keyed Extras is provided under a Sponsorware model. This policy outlines simple guidelines for fair use of the package.

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Sponsorship Tiers**: Please select a sponsorship tier appropriate for your use case as described on our GitHub Sponsors page. We trust our sponsors to choose the right tier based on whether they're using keyed-extras for personal projects or commercial work.

2. **Usage**: Feel free to use Keyed Extras in your projects according to your selected tier.

3. **Distribution**: Please don't publicly share or distribute the source code. This helps maintain the Sponsorware model that funds ongoing development.

4. **Created Content**: You own all content created using Keyed Extras. Feel free to share, sell, or distribute your animations and projects.

5. **Access**: Your access to updates requires an active sponsorship, but you can continue using your installed version (or private copies of `keyed-extras`) indefinitely.

## In Practice

This policy aims to be straightforward and lightweight. We trust our sponsors to use the package responsibly while supporting its continued development.
